# Cloudy with a Chance of Mobile
## .NET Everywhere with MAUI and Blazor

Since the very beginning, the vision of .NET has been to offer a viable alternative to Java - a runtime that can be distributed with executable code, allowing it to be run on any operating system or device.

When .Net Core was released in 2016, this dream started to become a reality. You could write .Net code that would run on any platform. Following this came Blazor, letting you run .Net code natively in the browser through WASM. And now we have MAUI, the next evolution of Xamarin.Forms that let's you write UI code that you can run anywhere.

In this repository, I demonstrate the power of the .Net everywhere dream - with a backend written in .Net, a web UI in Blazor, and deskop/mobile UIs written in MAUI.
